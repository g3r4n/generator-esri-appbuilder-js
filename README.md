# generator-wab [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Esri/generator-wab.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Esri/generator-wab)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to help customize [the ArcGIS Web AppBuilder](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/).

## About

This generator scaffolds out the boilerplate files that are needed when you are customizing the Web AppBuilder. This includes [generators](#running-the-generators) to creates project files (`package.json`, `.jshintrc`, etc) and scaffold out the files needed to create a new custom widget and custom theme.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Yeoman from npm (if not already), run:

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

To install generator-wab from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-wab
```

### Running the Generators

The generators should be run in the root folder of either the stem app or an app that you've already created with the Web AppBuilder.

#### App (Default) Generator

Currently the app generator doesn't do much other than install some project files (`package.json`, `.jshintrc`, etc) and ensure required subfolders (like `widgets`) exist. The subgenerators do most of the work.

1. Navigate into either `stemapp` or `server/apps/[appId]` under your local Web AppBuilder installation
2. Run the generator with `yo wab`
3. Answer the man's questions!

|Prompt|Description|Default|
|------|-----------|-------|
|Author|Name of developers or organization for widget manifests|Your Name or Organization|

#### Widget Generator

Scaffolds out the files needed to create a new custom widget.

1. Navigate into either `stemapp` or `server/apps/[appId]` under your local Web AppBuilder installation
2. Run the generator with `yo wab:widget`
3. Answer the man's questions!

|Prompt|Description|Default|
|------|-----------|-------|
|Widget Name|Folder name for output files and widget identifier|MyWidget|
|Widget Title|Name users see in widget selector and panel title bar|My Widget|
|Description|What does this widget do? (optional)|A custom Web AppBuilder widget|
|Base Class|The widget's base class|my-widget|
|Run inside a panel|Will your widget run inside a panel?|Yes|
|Locale (i18n) file|Will your widget require a locale file?|Yes|
|Style (CSS) file|Will your widget require a style file?|Yes|
|Config (JSON) file|Will your widget require a configuration file?|Yes|
|Template (HTML) file|Will your widget require a template file?|Yes|

Taking the default values for the prompts will generate the following output under the `widgets` folder:

```
MyWidget
│   config.json
│   manifest.json
│   Widget.html
│   Widget.js
│
├───css
│       style.css
│
├───images
│       icon.png
│
└───nls
        strings.js
```

The next time you run the Web AppBuilder, you will see something like the following on the widgets panel:

### Theme Generator

Scaffolds out the files needed to create a new custom theme based on the default Foldable Theme by Esri.

1. Navigate into either `stemapp` or `server/apps/[appId]` under your local Web AppBuilder installation
2. Run the generator with `yo wab:theme`
3. Answer the man's questions!

|Prompt|Description|Default|
|------|-----------|-------|
|Theme Name|Folder name for output files and theme identifier|DefaultThemeName|
|Description|Give a description of your custom theme|A good description of my theme...|
|Author|Your name or organization to be associated with the theme|My organization|
